NSDFA,OTN-Global,"Nova Scotia environmental sensor sites ","CMAR, in conjunction with the NS Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture is currently funding an initiative focused on increasing the understanding of the coastal marine resource.  The work involves collecting environmental data to better understand aspects such as the temperature, oxygen, currents and physical properties of the coastline of Nova Scotia. The collection of information relating to the many uses of the resource as well as the experience and understanding of the resource by existing users is fundamental to the success of this initiative.  The data collected can then be used to support good decision making in the optimal development of the coastal resource. To inform shellfish, marine plant and finfish aquaculture siting and practices that best suit the environment, provide increased resource information for the commercial and sport fishing industries, provide valuable information to communities for use in coastal planning relating to storm or extreme weather, climate change, tourism opportunities, aquaculture opportunities, and investment attraction.  This information and data collection effort is inclusive and is looking for partners in local communities, marine industry experts, traditional knowledge holders, first nations, youth, academics, and government agencies to aid in the activities associated with collecting information.","Balch, T., et al. 2018.

V2LFALK,OTN-Global,Brown trout in the Falkland Islands,"Brown trout (Salmo trutta) were introduced to the Falkland Islands on several occasions during the 1940ís and 1950ís, mostly for recreational fishing. Since, there has been a marked decline in the native freshwater fish fauna, which consists of only three species of galaxiid fishes, endemic to the Southern Hemisphere (zebra trout Aplochiton zebra, Aplochiton taeniatus, and the Falklands minnow Galaxias maculatus; Vanhaecke et al. 2012). Given the threats to the long-term conservation of the native galaxiids, detailed knowledge about the life history, movement ecology of brown trout and their overlap and interactions with the native species is urgently needed. However, at present virtually nothing is known about the extent and seasonality of brown trout movements in the Falkland Islands, or how these can impact on native galaxiids. Two presence/absence surveys, conducted 10 and 20 years ago respectively, provided valuable synoptic snapshots of the distribution of brown trout and galaxiids in the Falklands. McDowall et al. (2001) used electrofishing to survey the islands in 1999 and showed that brown trout had invaded most rivers with the exception of those in the southwest region of West Falkland (Lafonia). Elsewhere, brown trout showed a high degree of spatial segregation with zebra trout in particular, which may indicate competitive displacement and/or predation of zebra trout by brown trout, and may thus explain the decline of Aplochiton sp. since the 1950s. At the time of the survey, most zebra trout were concentrated within small refuge areas uninvaded by brown trout. However, the tendency of brown trout to display anadromy in the Falklands, makes it likely that they could eventually colonize all the accessible rivers. The risk of native galaxiid extinction is therefore high. With this in mind, our study aims to answer two main questions about the movement ecology of brown trout in the Falklands: (1) what is the current distribution, abundance and population structure of brown trout? and (2) what are the impacts of brown trout on native galaxiids? These questions will be answered by employing a variety of techniques including environmental DNA to non-destructively assess the distribution and abundance of brown trout and native galaxiids in various watershed, in conjunction with electrofishing, which will allow us to estimate population (or river stock) abundance as well as assess the health and reproductive status of individuals and stocks. Electrofishing will also provide us with an opportunity to capture individual brown trout for acoustic tagging from different watersheds, thus allowing us to meet our first aim by tracking individual movements and dispersal patterns, among watersheds and between East and West Falklands. We will also take fin samples from individuals for genotyping, thus obtaining data on the genetic diversity and gene flow between watersheds of brown trout and native species. Stable isotope analysis will also be conducted on fin samples from brown trout and native galaxiids to determine the levels of trophic overlap and predation between species.","Minett, J., Garcia de Leaniz, C., Consuegra, S., Crossin, G., Brickle, P. 2018.Brown trout in the Falkland Islands: invasion ecology, population structure and genetic diversity.",Jessica Minett,Swansea U,787346@swansea.ac.uk,http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/V2LFALK.htm,; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH,GCMD,,,"By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

V2LCASP,OTN-Global,Canaries Angel Shark Project,"Angel sharks (Squatina squatina) are one of the most endangered fish in European waters and are currently listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The Canary Islands have been identified as a unique stronghold for S. squatina, where they are regularly sighted by divers and fishers. However, here too they are under significant threat from incidental catch in poorly-managed commercial and recreational fisheries, habitat degradation from pollution, coastal development and marine infrastructure and disturbance by divers and beach users. Over the last three years, the Angel Shark Project has become the established authority for angel shark conservation and research in Europe. This has been established through gathering critical information on angel shark distribution via our network of partners including sport fishers, dive operators and local NGOs. The proposed project therefore builds on this distribution data to address key questions about residency and space use of S. squatina. The lack of knowledge around the timing and distances of movements in this species is hampering current efforts to establish and implement protection throughout the area. As such, the data from a deployment of year-round acoustic receivers will directly inform the Spanish Government’s proposed management strategies for The Canaries. In addition to movement data, this collaborative project funded by the National Geographic and Lisbon aquarium, is developing a bespoke tagging and attachment methodology to enable the external tagging of angel sharks in situ as they rest on the substrate, avoiding capture and stress of individuals. This open source methodology will likely facilitate the attachment of tags to other benthic species where capture of individuals is problematic or politically sensitive. To our knowledge, this will be the first deployment of long-term tracking equipment for S. squatina providing essential data that will act as a baseline for future actions attempting to conserve this species.","Barker, J., Alvarado, D., Meyers, E., Jacoby, D. 2018.

NARR,OTN-Global,"Characterizing the behavior and survival of age 1 hatchery stocked smolts in the Narraguagus River, Maine U.S.A.","NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA) has been evaluating emigrating Atlantic salmon (ATS) smolt dynamics and survival via acoustic telemetry  within the Narraguagus River since 1997. Optimizing the number of smolts that enter the ocean from coastal rivers and into the Gulf of Maine is a management priority.  Until recently, the Narraguagus River has been solely supported by natural reproduction and fry stocking within the watershed. In 2008, a five year smolt stocking effort was implemented with intentions of boosting adult returns.  Approximately 40,000 smolts were stocked annually over this five year period with limited success. 154 2SW adult returns were documented, which is 5.6 2SW adults per 10,000 smolts stocked. These results are much lower than the natural component (63.2/10,000) of the Narraguagus and returns from age 1 hatchery smolt stocking on other nearby systems during the same timeframe. Through this effort we will investigate and describe the behavior and success of conservation hatchery smolt with differing release times migrating through the river, estuary, and nearshore environment to determine if there are differences between groups.  In addition to migration performance, we will identify bottlenecks (predation, environment, habitat, etc) which will inform managers of areas of focus during restoration efforts within the watershed to optimize the number of post smolts entering the Gulf of Maine.","Hawkes, J.P., Goulette, G.S. 2017.

V2LCOCOS,OTN-Global,"Acoustic monitoring of threatened and endangered sea turtles and sharks in Cocos Island National Park, and the Southern Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica","Management and conservation of highly migratory marine species requires information on their migratory movements during their different lift stages, such as temporary residence sites and periods, identification of rookeries and adult aggregation sites, as well as the migratory paths that interconnect these sites.  Sharks in general, hammerhead sharks in particular, have been under heavy fishing pressure during the last 6 decades, an overfishing process fueled by the high price of shark fins in Asian markets for the elaboration of soup.  Sea turtles are put at high extinction risk by industrial fisheries, a collateral damage, or incidental bycatch of fisheries that target valuable pelagic species.  In principle, a high priority when designing conservation strategies for these highly migratory species should be to avoid interactions with fisheries in the first place.  A network of Marine Protected Areas has been established along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica that roughly covers 1% of the nationís Exclusive Economic Zone, a network which includes different degrees of protection, from National Wildlife Refuge (some allowance of economic activities) to no-take zones (National Parks and Biological Reserves).  Since 2005 an acoustic monitoring program of hammerhead sharks started in Cocos Island National Park that currently includes 7 listening stations deployed around the island.  The program eventually spread to include other species of sharks and sea turtles, as well as to the Costa Rican mainland, along the southern Nicoya Peninsula.  A partnership with colleagues in Galapagos, Ecuador, and Malpelo, Colombia, who are studying the same species with the same VEMCO acoustic technology, has allowed for the publication of 5 peer reviewed papers on the movements of hammerhead sharks and implications of conservation and management.  Current research is focused on studying the importance of seamounts in waters surrounding Cocos Island National Park for the migratory movements of sea turtles and sharks, and defining the migratory paths through which these animals migrate, to provide decision makers with high quality science for the establishment of conservation and management policy.","Chaves, E., Hearn, A., Arauz, R. 2018.

KNE,OTN-Global,NOAA Kennebec Salmon Tracking,"NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA) has been evaluating emigrating Atlantic salmon (ATS) smolt dynamics and survival via ultrasonic telemetry since 1997 (Kocik et al. 2009). Initial telemetry studies were of native populations in the Narraguagus River and have since expanded to other rivers and varying age classes of both hatchery and naturally-reared smolts. This project is NOAA’s first investigation into naturally-reared ATS smolt dynamics in the Kennebec system. The Kennebec River forms part of the Merrymeeting Bay itself which is comprised of six river systems including the Androscoggin River.  The Merrymeeting Bay type formation, due to its joining of two large river systems, can only be found in three other places on earth (Burroughs 2006). We are focused on better understanding smolt migration dynamics, quantifying migration success and identifying areas of high mortality through estuarine and bay areas within the study array and beyond into coastal waters in collaborations with OTN and other partners. We use this information in support of management activities to reduce threats, evaluate project impacts and work windows, and to improve ATS survival in the near shore marine environment. We are tracking smolts from the lower Kennebec River, through Merrymeeting Bay and lower Kennebec Estuary using an array of ~ 30 receivers deployed and maintained in cooperation with the Maine Department of Marine Resources.

PBU,OTN-Global,USGS: Salmon tagging,"The proposed plan to remove the Veazie and Great Works dams on the Penobscot River (as part of the Penobscot River Restoration) offers an unusual opportunity to examine the ecological and environmental changes surrounding a major river restoration in New England. Considerable runs of anadromous fish (e.g., American shad, alewife, sea lamprey and Atlantic salmon) occurred in the Penobscot River prior to the construction of main-stem dams in the early 1800's. Migratory fish populations declined precipitously after dams were installed. With the planned removal of two main-stem dams on the Penobscot River beginning 2012, there is great optimism that reestablishment of passage will lead to restoration of the ecosystem. This restoration would include improved migration and passage of migrating fish. Though these anticipated changes are a major impetus for the restoration activities, the scope of recovery for migratory species will necessarily depend on the degree to which connectivity is realized. Fish passage at the remaining dams, both upstream and downstream, is necessary for the completion of the life histories of many fishes. This proposed work is aimed at characterizing current and future passage conditions of Atlantic salmon and other migratory fishes.","Zydlewski, J. 2005.

IFS1,OTN-Global,OTN Canada Atlantic Salmon Smolt DST Study,"The focus of the research was two pronged: (1) on the testing  of tag shape and tagging methodologies for fitting smolts with the miniaturized versions of Data Storage Tags (DST’s), and (2) ultimately, on the tagging and release of smolts at the Campellton River. This study was initiated in May 2010 and is ongoing. On 14 May 2010, 102 smolts from the Rocky River, Newfoundland, and captured at a smolt trap, were transported to the Ocean Sciences Centre (Memorial University) for testing tag attachment methodologies. An outbreak of a flavobacterium at the end of May lead to 24 mortalities and the need to treat the fish with tetracycline. The remaining fish recovered and were tagged on 6 July: 20 with an internal version of the dummy DST, with a light stalk protruding from the body cavity; 40 with an external version of the dummy DST, 20 attached with a bridle design in the dorsal musculature and 20 with a tether through the dorsal musculature; and 14 fish served as controls, with PIT tags for individual identification. These fish were monitored through November 2010. Our findings indicated that the tether attachment was the most effective methodology; many of the internal tags were expelled over the course of 1.5 mo and bridles caused excessive wear. Further testing, including swim chamber tests, with refined tag shapes and tagging methodologies was commenced November 2010 and ran through to February 2011.

BFTTAG,OTN-Global,"Estimating Bluefin tuna post release mortality, fish size and fidelity using high resolution multi-beam sonar and acoustic tags.","Bluefin tuna and many other species are hooked and released in recreational fisheries around the world. The challenge is to determine the size of the fish and what actually happens after the fish are released. Traditionally very expensive archival and satellite tags have been used to monitor movement and estimate post release mortality. However, new high resolution multi-beam sonar is capable of visually tracking tuna detected with acoustic tags at distances of up to 1000m in real time while actively transmitting. This provides a mechanism of tracking the fish and monitoring its behaviour immediately upon it release. The sonar system is also capable of estimating the size of individual targets to within a few cm, while they are on the line or being run prior to release. Because the tags have a battery life 3 years or more and are detectable by the OTN arrays, movements of tagged fish may be passively monitored by the arrays and actively monitored by our team when they return to the same survey areas for several years. The objective of the project is to collaborate with the fishing industry (recreational and commercial) to estimate the size of bluefin tuna while still in the water and to estimate their post release mortality using the much less expensive acoustic tags and multi-beam sonar. Subsequent observations would be made if the fish returned to the fishing area. The technology will allow the monitoring of fish behaviour immediately after release. Recent studies using this sonar technology have clearly illustrated the detection of bluefin tuna and estimated their swimming speed and inter-spatial distance between fish when aggregated.","Melvin, G.D. 2017.

IFC,OTN-Global,Ian Fleming Cod Tagging,"The emerging Atlantic cod farming industry faces the common aquaculture problem of escapes. Cod, like many cultured marine fishes, are particularly prone to escape from sea cages by biting holes in nets. Following escape, farmed cod interact with wild cod. The depleted populations of wild cod in the northwest Atlantic may be especially vulnerable to negative interactions with escapees. We are asking the question: what do farmed cod do following escape? We used acoustic telemetry to investigate behaviour (dispersal) following a simulated escape from a sea cage. Wild (locally caught) cod dispersed from the cage more quickly than farmed cod, taking 5.5 hours for 50% of the wild cod to disperse > 1 km from the cage site, compared with 12.6 h for farmed cod. Farmed cod spent most of their time near the cage, while wild cod spent most of their time at the mouth of the bay at a traditional feeding ground. Following departure from the cage area, farmed and wild cod dispersed mostly northward along the coast, and within 4.5 months post release 55% of wild and 88% of farmed cod had been detected on an acoustic receiver array located 25 km northward of the cage site close to the coastline. The results suggest that escaped farmed cod could only be recaptured near the cage within a day of the escape event. Following the initial escape period, farmed cod showed a similar dispersal pattern to wild cod and could potentially interact with them. The results of our study can be applied to the emerging cod aquaculture industry, as well as that of other marine finfish, to reduce the number of escapes, streamlining the development of the industry before mitigation becomes too difficult and costly to implement.","Fleming, I.A., Zimmerman, E., Purchase, C.F., Brattey, J., Porter, D. 2011.

V2LHITUR,OTN-Global,Hutchinson Island Power Plant Green Turtle Telemetry Study,"Inwater Research Group captures sea turtles that swim into the intake canal of the FPL St. Lucie nuclear power plant on Hutchinson Island. A half mile south of the power plant is a sabellariid worm reef named Walton Rocks. Walton Rocks is home to a resident population of green sea turtles and Inwater Research Group has many recaptures for green turtles via flipper and PIT tags, presumably from turtles inhabiting this Walton Rocks habitats. The receivers would allow us to determine how frequently the turtles are near the intake structures, and how frequently they actually become entrained into the canal itself. We also want to examine movement of green turtles between two bodies of water on either side of Hutchinson Island--the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean. We hypothesize that turtles utilize the waters of the lagoon during summer months but when the water temperatures drop in the winter, the turtles may move to the warmer ocean warmers and utilize the habitat by Walton Rocks. Therefore, by placing the loaned OTN receivers on the ocean side, there would be receivers on both sides of the barrier island. Our plan is to then capture and acoustically tag turtles from the power plant (ocean side) and at a lagoon site and examine the movements of turtles between the two bodies of water.","Guertin, J., Mott, C. 2017.

HGN,OTN-Global,NEFSC Gray Seal Distribution in US and Canadian Northwest Atlantic,"Gray seal populations in U.S. waters have been increasing since the early 1990s, following a period of decline from a once plentiful population (Wood et al. 2011). Gray seals observed in U.S. waters are part of a larger northwest Atlantic stock ranging from northern parts of Canada to the southern Mid-Atlantic (Waring et al. 2016). While the majority of the population resides in Canadian waters, sightings of animals in the U.S that were branded on Sable Island, Canada, as well as satellite telemetry data from tagged animals, indicate transboundary movements of individuals. Increases in pup production at U.S. pupping colonies suggest that gray seals from Canada are supplementing U.S. gray seal populations, but rates of immigration from Canada to the U.S. are unknown. Concurrent with the increase in the gray seal population, particularly around Cape Cod and the Islands, has been an increase in the great white shark population. While great whites are a known predator of gray seals, the dynamics of their interactions are less well known. The purpose of this project is to gather acoustic and thermal transmissions from gray seals tagged on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to provide insight to their local and international movements as well as co-occurrence with great white sharks.","Kocik, J., Skomal, G., Kimberly, M., Hayes, S. 2017.

BDK,OTN-Global,"Overwinter biology, migrations, and carryover effects of Bras d’Or Atlantic salmon populations","Although they have the capacity to survive a first reproductive attempt, post-spawning Atlantic salmon (or kelts) are found in a nutritionally depleted state and their subsequent migratory decisions and reconditioning represent a critical phase of their life history. Kelts native to the Bras d’Or Lakes (BdL), a unique brackish-water inland sea of Cape Breton Island, have three options: i. remaining in their natal river for the winter; ii. migrating immediately downriver to this vast estuary and overwinter there; or iii. migrating immediately downriver, through the estuary, and directly to sea. Despite limited knowledge on the kelt life stage, post-spawning condition is believed to influence decisions about migration timing and strategy, with implications for longer-term survival. The main objectives of this research project are: 1. to document kelts habitat use and residency pattern in the Bras d’Or Lakes; and 2. to evaluate the influence of kelts post-spawning condition on migration behaviour and survival. In order to do so, in fall 2014 and 2015, a total of 61 kelts were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and bio-sampled for indicators of their physiological state. Ultimately, this research will provide new insights into the role of the Bras d’Or Lakes system in Atlantic salmon life cycle, and more broadly to factors underlying kelts mortality.","Crossin, G.T., Hatcher, B.G., Sheng, J. 2014.

PIUI,OTN-Global,Spatio-temporal habitat partitioning between lionfish species on coral reefs,"Habitat partitioning is a well-known strategy to reduce competition among species that consume similar resources. Species might separate their habitat spatially, temporally or both.  While numerous example for such habitat partitioning are know from land, until recent years fine-grained habitat utilization data in the ocean has been difficult to collect preventing the identification of such patterns. In the Gulf of Aqaba two species of lionfish co-exist\; Pterois miles and Pterois radiata. These species are common predators on the coral reef. Moreover, Pterois miles is invasive in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean and may have adverse impacts on indigenous fish communities. Since these species have similar diets and are morphologically similar it is unclear how they manage to co-exist within a single habitat. In this research, we use acoustic telemetry technology in order to estimate each species space-use patterns, activity times and depth range. This will be used to assess whether spatial or temporal habitat partitioning occurs between these species. This information will also be used to understand lionfish behavior in its native range which can then be compared to its behavior in the invaded range.","Belmaker,Y., Pickholtz,R., Kiflawi,M., Gavriely,T. 2017.

NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) plays a significant and positive role in regional wildlife management issues because it contains or borders some of the best remaining coastal habitat left in east Florida, and encompasses the oldest marine reserve in the United States. The KSC Ecological Program is using both passive acoustic telemetry and traditional fisheries techniques to resolve questions concerning the abundance, site fidelity, spawning locations, and coastal migrations of our region's most economically and ecologically important sportfish and shark species. We also monitor the movements of sea turtles who use waters at Cape Canaveral as a developmental habitat. Besides advancing basic knowledge of fish and turtle life history, our findings help understand the consequences of natural and human disturbance events (e.g., algae blooms, cold snaps, dredging, shoreline development), and have been used for Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultations, revising of EFH maps, and updating federal and state stock assessments.","Reyier, E., Provancha, J., Ahr, B, Scheidt, D, Holloway-Adkins, K. 2017.

Building on the Stanford Universityís Tag-a-Giant a research program which began in 1994, the Tag-A-Giant (TAG) organization was founded in 2006 by a dedicated group of scientists and recreational fishermen to support scientific research, policy and conservation initiatives that promote a sustainable future for bluefin tuna. Tag-A-Giant is committed to reversing the decline of northern bluefin tuna populations by supporting the scientific research necessary to develop innovative and effective policy and conservation initiatives. TAG scientists have electronically tagged nearly 1,800 northern bluefin tuna in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins to document the speciesí movements, habitat use, inter-year fidelity to feeding and breeding sites, and to estimate natural mortality rates. Tracking work has been combined with other new technologies including genetic analyses to develop new insights into the species ecology, physiology and behavior.

Adult salmon are being captured at a fish ladder in the northeast branch of the SMR, transported by truck, and released upstream of a pair of large waterfalls that act as a natural barrier to fish passage. For this mitigation strategy to succeed, transported adults must survive (and remain in the novel habitat) to reproduce, and offspring must survive to migrate to the ocean. Thus, the overarching aim of this project is to gain a scientific understanding of the colonization of the newly accessible habitat in the Sainte-Marguerite River. Beginning in summer 2014, we will be tagging transported adults with Vemco V13 tags to address examine in-river pre-spawning behavior, spawning habitat use and post-spawning behavior, including kelt m igration and survival.","Frechette, D., Bergeron, N., Dionne, M., Dodson, J., Caron, F. 2014.

DRMUCF,OTN-Global,Assessing the role of estuarine impoundments and marine mammal exclusion devices on red drum movement patterns,"The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) is one of the most diverse estuaries in North America and serves as critical habitat for a multitude of fish species.  One of the most economically valuable sportfish in the Indian River Lagoon is the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Previous local studies of red drum document strong site fidelity, with some mature individuals residing and spawning within the lagoon year-round (Reyier et al 2011).  This behavior is uncommon in other portions of their geographic range, suggesting future abundance and harvest of red drum is partially dependent on continued spawning success within the lagoon. The Integrate-Transfer-Launch (ITL) complex impoundments located within Kennedy Space Center security zone are proven spawning sites of red drum (Garreau et al 2014).  However, recent construction of manatee exclusion bollards around culverts leading into these impoundments on roads operated by Cape Canaveral Air Force Station may be impacting movement to and from these historic spawning sites. This project proposes to use acoustic telemetry to quantify patterns of red drum movement and habitat use within the Kennedy Space Center security zone, and to assess how manatee exclusion bollards in the ITL-impoundment area potentially impact movement of red drum.  These data will be used in conjunction with bollard size and spacing, pertinent morphometric data (e.g. length, head width, body width, weight), and habitat conditions to develop optimal management strategies that minimize potential adverse effects on manatees and maximize red drum access to spawning sites, thereby helping to ensure the sustainability of this iconic fishery.","Baker, SM., Reyier, EA., Cook, GS. 2017.

V2LTAMS,OTN-Global,Effectiveness of a no-take zone,"The establishment of no take zones has been recognized as an eficiente strategy to increase abundance and biomass of marine organisms of fisheries importance. In Tamandaré, South of Pernambuco state, a no take area was established in 1999, by Federal decree, and later included inside the boundaries of a Municipal Marine Park.  The area is part of  the Coral Coast MPA, the largest federal marine protected area in Brazil, with 135 ??. In 2013 the establishment of no-take zones was incorporated in the management plan and replicated along the coast within its boundaries. The expected benefits are not only recovery of marine life inside the area but also benefits to the outside areas through spillover of adults and propagules. Although higher number and biomass of species has been observed inside its boundaries, the benefit for adjacent areas through spill over of individuals needs to be verified.  To fulfil this need, a study of fish movement was designed and implemented in 2014. The aim is to evaluate reef fish habitat use and movement patterns, spill over effect and thus to determine no-take zone effectiveness. The Tamandaré array initially consisted of 10 VR2W receivers in the no take area and was expanded to an 18 receivers array in December 2016, covering both the no take area and its surroundings (through a collaboration with Texas A&M University). Areas with distinct reef morphologies (shallow and deep patch reefs, deep submerged reefs, back reef and front reef areas) and physical conditions (wave action, current and tidal effects) are being monitored and the array covers depths from about 1m to 15m. So far, 28 gray parrotfishes (Sparisoma axillare) and 11 Brazilian snappers (Lutjanus alexandrei) have been captured inside the NTZ and tagged with V9 and V8 VEMCO transmitters.

FPS,OTN-Global,Inner Bay of Fundy Salmon Tracking,"Smolts were collected from the Upper Salmon river (USR) in Fundy National Park in 2010 and reared to grilse stage in captive outdoor sea-cages. This project will evaluate homing success of these fish from a release site in the Inner Bay of Fundy. The smolts originate from efforts of conservation river-stocking of native strains of fry and fall parr in years past. After capture at the mouth of the USR, the smolts were transported to a commercial sea cage operated by the aquaculture industry in Back Bay NB for rearing. In addition to cage-reared smolt, a similar group of grilse reared in a Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) hatchery in Mactaquac NB will be released to determine effects of smolt-grilse rearing strategy on homing success. Fish are planned to be released well inside the Inner Bay of Fundy near Fundy National Park. All fish will be tagged with an externally visible tag for detection by ongoing dive surveys on the USR if they successfully home to the river they were captured from in 2010.  To corroborate diver observations, we will deploy acoustic receivers at the mouth of USR and adjacent rivers and implant acoustic tags in a subset of the released fish to estimate homing and stray rates. As with any tagging project of this nature, results and associated conclusions are improved with increasing numbers of tagged individuals.   Recovery programs for Inner Bay of Fundy Salmon have been unsuccessful in producing suitable numbers of returning individuals yet it is unclear whether captive reared fish are being lost to various threats during marine migration or simply do not have the natural instinct to return.  This project provides valuable knowledge for salmon recovery program managers by evaluating the ability of captive-reared salmon to return to rivers they migrated from as smolt.  Results will be of particular value to a projected increasing number of salmon recovery program managers as more populations become threatened with decline. Our program is a collaborative effort between Parks Canada, DFO, The Atlantic Canada Fish Farmers Association, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Concordia University as well as the Atlantic Salmon Federation. Although this is a Parks Canada Species at Risk program, a much of the data generated will be contributing to an MSc graduate program (finishing in 2013) and associated publications.","Clarke, C., Mazerolle, D., Purchase, C., Fraser, D., Goff, T., MacDonald, D., Streight, H., House, B., Carr, C., O'Reilly, P. 2010.

ACS,OTN-Global,OTN Arctic Cumberland Sound Array,"Cumberland Sound, on southern Baffin Island, supports a wide variety and number of arctic fish, seabird and marine mammal species and a community of 1,400 people (Pangnirtung). Significant changes have occurred in the Cumberland Sound ecosystem in the recent past, which are likely due to climatic changes. Ice condition is the most obvious change as the duration of ice cover and the extent of land-fast ice have been reduced. These changes in arctic ice cover will likely have serious impacts on the trophic interactions and movements of arctic species. This project will target the spatial, seasonal and temporal interaction of fish and marine mammals in the Cumberland Sound ecosystem. This will be accomplished by overlying the spatial and temporal movements of key fish and marine mammal species using a combination of satellite tags, acoustic (V6) and chat tags, and an array of VR2W receivers in the Sound, with current and on going studies of trophic interactions using stomach contents and chemical tracers (stable isotopes) from numerous species and levels of the trophic system.","Fisk, A. 2010.

ALS,OTN-Global,OTN Arctic Lancaster Sound Array,"Lancaster Sound, and Allen Bay, specifically is close to the community of Resolute. Lancaster Sound supports a diverse variety of arctic fish, birds and marine mammal. Allen Bay is an important hunting area for the community of Resolute where large schools of arctic cod occur and seabirds, seals and beluga concentrate to feed on arctic cod. Significant changes are occurring in the marine environment most notable is earlier ice breakup but with this earlier breakup there are more ice floes throughout the open water period and these ice floes often move unpredictably in and out of  Allen Bay. The project concentrates on arctic cod, a keystone species, and its spatial, seasonal and temporal interactions with the environment and its predators which range from sculpins to marine mammals. A key objective is to correlate the size and density of arctic cod schools with predation by fish, marine birds and mammals. Fish/ environment interaction use acoustic tags (V5, V6 and V9) implanted in fish to assess location, depth, temperature and movements. Environmental variables are measured spatially and temporally and correlated with fish and mammal movements. Trophic interactions are defined by using diet and chemical tracers (stable isotopes) from numerous species and trophic levels.","Fisk, A. 2010.

ANL,OTN-Global,Arctic Nettling Lake,"Nettilling Lake, the largest lake in Nunavut and the largest found on an island in the world, has the largest commercial Char quota in the Eastern Arctic at 22,700 kg (Kristofferson et al. 1991). The Nettilling Lake fishery has been dormant since at least 2001 due to the high cost of air transportation of harvested char back to Iqaluit by Twin Otter airplanes (Janelle Kennedy, personal communication). Nettilling Lake is connected to the ocean (Foxe Basin) to the west by the Koukdjuak River, and to the large Amadjuak Lake to the south via the Amadjuak River. Amadjuak Lake has its own Char quota of 9,100 kg, but this quota has never been active because the Char population is considered to be landlocked and thus, vulnerable to exploitation. It is also thought to be of lesser value due to high parasite loads (Popko 1980, Kristofferson et al. 1991). In August of 2013 and 2014, previously unknown Arctic Char migrations were documented in the Amadjuak River and the north end of Amadjuak lake that included all three known morphs (landlock green, anadromous orange and anadromous silver) (William Hyndman, unpublished data). This strongly suggests that anadromous char may be present in Amadjuak Lake opening the possibility of a fishery that is closer to Iqaluit and consequently more economically viable. In addition to the obvious fishery opportunities that Lake Nettilling/Amadjuak offers, there are many unanswered questions over the general biology and ecology of Arctic Char in this unique freshwater system, particularly relating to the different morphotypes. Given the two colours of anadromous morphotypes, questions remain about the relative importance of lake resources and whether the potentially large food base of this lake explains the abundance of the different morphs. Given this, we hypothesize that the anadromous �silver� morphotypes (anadromous char were identified by smaller heads and bigger bodies), that are more similar in colouration to the landlock morphotypes, have a greater reliance on lake production than orange morphotypes? There also exists a wide range of possible movement and migration strategies of Arctic Char in the Nettilling/Amadjuak system given the complexity of the ecosystem that includes a number of rivers, two large lakes, and potentially numerous smaller lakes. Given the colour types in the two anadromous morphs, could orange individuals spend more time at sea? Do the three morphotypes have variable movement behaviors in the system and/or do they choose unique spawning locations? Given the lack of basic information on these Arctic Char populations, a first step to ensure sustainable harvesting if fisheries developed is to understand their large-scale movements patterns. This would include the times fish leave and return from the ocean and the times of movement within winter residency locations between the two large lakes and numerous lakes of the Amadjuak River.","Larocque, S., Young, A., Kennedy, J., Hyndman, W., Tallman, R., Weinz, A., Fisk, A. 2014.",Aaron Fisk,U Windsor,afisk@uwindsor.ca,http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/ANL.htm,DETECTIONS; ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS; ACOUSTIC TRANSCEIVERS; ; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH,GCMD,,,"By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

ANT,OTN-Global,"Sea-Run Brook Trout, Antigonish Harbour, NS - tag releases and receiver deployments","The year-round marine migration of sea-run Brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, in Antigonish Harbour, Nova Scotia, will be investigated using acoustic tags and receivers starting January 2010 and continuing until December 2011.  Migration range, duration, movements, habitat use and feeding behaviour in relation to environmental conditions will be investigated.  Very little is known about the movements and feeding of sea-trout.  There are only 3 recent studies on Quebec populations from the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Lenormand et al., 2004; Curry et al., 2006; Morinville and Rasmussen, 2006).  Considering Brook trout are the most popular sports fishery in Nova Scotia (MacMillan and Madden, 2007), regional knowledge of feeding habitats and access routes, combined with environmental interactions, is needed to enhance conservation efforts (Morinville and Rasmussen, 2006; Brenkman et al., 2007). In recent years, fishing pressure on sea-run trout has increased.  A Special Trout Management Area (STMA) was implemented in 2001 in the West River (AH) and immediate estuary to improve the size (FL>35 cm, >3 yrs old) and number of trout caught.  Exploitation outside the STMA is unknown, but comparative creel surveys before and after 2001has shown an increase in overall sizes, and ages to 4 and 5 yr old fish (MacMillan and Madden, 2007).  This tracking study will examine the effectiveness of the zone by monitoring movements of West River trout, and may also provide an estimate of angling exploitation.  The diet of migrating fish will also be examined by obtaining stomachs and muscle tissue from local fishers.","Spares, A., MacMillan. J., Madden. R., Stokesbury, M., O’Dor. R., Halfyard, E. 2010.

BOOOBC,OTN-Global,"Habitat use of coastal sharks in Back Sound, North Carolina","Despite the importance of estuaries as nursery and foraging habitat for coastal sharks, little is known of their fine-scale habitat preferences.  To determine if acoustic telemetry could be an effective means of analyzing fine-scale estuarine habitat use, an acoustic array consisting of eight Vemco VR2W 69 kHz acoustic receivers were deployed around the perimeter of Middle Marsh in Back Sound, North Carolina.  Receivers were deployed such that a single microhabitat type was spatially dominant within detection range.  Microhabitats chosen for comparison were deep (> 2 m) channels, shallow (< 2 m) sand flats, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds, and receivers were deployed at sites both relatively nearer and farther from Beaufort Inlet, the closest access to the Atlantic Ocean.  Receivers at seagrass and sand flat sites were deployed between May 28 and June 5, 2015, and receivers loaned by the Ocean Tracking Network were deployed at oyster reef and deep channel sites on September 30, 2015.  All receivers were recovered on November 11-12, 2015.  Blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), blacknose (Carcharhinus acronotus), bull (Carcharhinus leucas), and bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) sharks were targeted for acoustic tagging.  Sharks were captured using gillnet, longline, and drumline gear deployed as part of a fishery-independent survey conducted in Back and Core Sounds from April through October 2015.  Individuals of the four target species and in good condition at capture were tagged by surgically implanting a Vemco V16 69 kHz transmitter into the body cavity.  Habitat preference was analyzed using the number of detections and number of visits, defined as a periods of continuous detection, at a particular receiver site.  One blacktip shark and three blacknose sharks were acoustically tagged, of which two blacknose sharks were detected on the array.  One appeared to suffer post-release mortality and was continuously detected on both the oyster reef far from inlet and seagrass bed near inlet receivers from two days after tagging until receivers were recovered, suggesting it or the tag had settled on the bottom between those receivers.  The other blacknose shark was detected briefly at the sand flat near inlet site approximately an hour after tagging.  In addition, a cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus), finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon), and bull shark tagged by other members of the Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry Network were detected on the array.  Of all tagged elasmobranchs, the bull shark, tagged by Debra Abercrombie from Stony Brook University, had both the highest number of detections and visits to array sites and appeared to show a preference for sand flat and oyster reef habitats, particularly at night.  These results show that acoustic telemetry focusing on habitat type can provide insight into the fine-scale estuarine habitat use patterns of high trophic level elasmobranchs.","Bangley, C.

American shad are often the focus of upstream and downstream fish passage studies on the east coast of North America but are easily stressed from handling. Accordingly, gastric insertion of a transmitter is considered the standard method for tagging for both radio and acoustic telemetry studies.  However, gastric tagging is not considered a viable long term methodology as fish will regurgitate or pass transmitters.  In 2015, we implemented a study of tag retention and survival comparing gastric tagging to three methods of surgical tagging (single suture closure of incision, no closure of incision, and chemical adhesive closure of incision).  We also designed and conducted a field study of adult shad in the Charles River, MA to inform future restoration of shad to that watershed.  In river tracking is designed to detect passage over dams and delays at locking structures.","Gahagan, B., Bailey, M. 2015.

IFS3,OTN-Global,Salmonids in the north,"The project aims to quantify potential responses of salmonid fishes to climate change, both in areas of species transition and in areas that are among most northern salmonid habitats. The western Atlantic coast from the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland to Nain in the Labrador is a species transition zone for anadromous salmonids, particularly Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus, but also brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). A parallel transition zone exists in Ungava Bay. The populations in these two areas represent some of the last remaining anadromous populations of salmonid fishes that exist in a relatively pristine state in eastern North America. Moreover, they are central to important subsistence (food) and recreational fisheries, and in some cases commercial fisheries, as well as in social and ceremonial fisheries for aboriginal peoples (e.g. along the Labrador coast, the Metis, Innu and Inuit). In 1997-98, the commercial fishery for Atlantic salmon in Labrador was closed due to declines in population sizes. However, recovery has been slow and now anadromous salmonids face new challenges associated with climate change, as well as development (i.e. highways and industry). Climate change has been predicted to significantly impact northern salmonids, influencing seasonal phenologies and life-history tactics (Reist et al. 2006, Todd et al. 2011). For instance, recent Scandinavian modelling studies have predicted climate-driven increases in primary production of lakes that may reduce the prevalence of anadromy in Arctic charr populations (Finstad and Hein 2012). There are also indications of Atlantic salmon spreading northward (DFO and MNRF 2008, Todd et al. 2011). The research proposed in this first component of the project aims to quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of estuarine and nearshore marine habitat use of co-existing salmonid populations as affected by niche segregation and life history in a changing climate. It integrates across Atlantic and Arctic arenas and links biotelemetry studies of animal movement to ecology, physiology and genomics drawing on expertise from within the team, as well as with the broader Ocean Tracking Network (e.g. Pacific arena salmonid research and the physical-biogeochemical ocean modelling) and beyond (i.e. collaborators in Scandinavia).","Fleming, I., Power, M., Robertson, M., Morris, C., Dempson, B. 2013.

LESPUR,OTN-Global,Spatial Ecology of spurdog (Squalus acanthias) in a Scottish loch system.,"Recent anthropogenic pressures including overfishing, climate change and habitat destruction have directly caused the global extinction of several marine species including chondrichthyans (sharks, skates, rays and chimeras). Overall chondrichthyan extinction risk is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates, due to their typical ëK strategistí life history characteristics; slow growth, late age of sexual maturity, low fecundity, long life spans and well-developed offspring making them vulnerable to over exploitation and average global exploitation rates often exceed the rebound rates for many species. In many ecosystems elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) fulfil the role of top level predators, the loss of predators often risks wider ecosystem degradation and can act as a herald for marked changes within ecosystems. Therefore, improved management of elasmobranch populations is needed urgently to ensure the future stability and recovery of marine ecosystems with functional top predators. Despite the wide-ranging behaviour of some elasmobranchs, it has been shown that many species make use of the same areas repeatedly either in the form of site fidelity or residency. The incorporation of such behaviours into the management plans for mobile species may allow for strategies such as Marine Protected Areas to be used. There is evidence that spurdog (Squalus acanthias) displays seasonal residency within a Scottish loch, Loch Etive, a sea loch on the west coast of Scotland, however, the extent to which this occurs between age and sex classes occurs. This was investigated using a static acoustic array and internally implanted acoustic tags on a range of age and sex classes.","Thorburn J, Henry LA, Dodd J, Neat F.

JDE,OTN-Global,OTN Canada American Eel Tracking,"The specific objectives of this project are two-fold: (a) to identify the key physical, chemical and biological characteristics of coastal ecosystems impacting the growth, maturation and migration of  American eels, and (b) to identify how anthropogenic activities may potentially exacerbate the already precarious status of the American eel. The OTN infrastructure and technology will be exploited to  establish the migration routes of both yellow and silver life-history stages from Lake Ontario to the St. Lawrence line and beyond to the Cabot Strait and Halifax lines as well as to identify the abiotic and  biotic conditions that prevail along the migratory pathway. Two stages of the species lifecycle will be investigated in the context of this project: yellow-stage eels (juveniles) and silver-stage eels  (reproductive stage). For both of these, a system-wide effort to capture and acoustically tag individuals will be conducted in the spring/summer of 2010 and 2011. Specific sampling areas will include  Cornwall, Montreal the Trois-Rivières region, Ile d'Orléans and along the south of the middle estuary where a traditional eel fishery occurs. Surgically implanted model V9 and V13 model tags, depending on  fish size, will be used (300 pingers in total). Several acoustic barriers will be installed along the St. Lawrence River and Estuary. Alongside these telemetry efforts, the different habitat-use patterns of  yellow eels will also be studied through the analysis of otolith microchemistry. The otolith analyses will be used to calculate age, growth and to establish chronologies of habitats used by the eel during  its growth. Migration routes of the silver eel stages towards the presumed spawning site (Sargasso Sea) will also be determined by V13 pingers. Furthermore, transmitter tags fitted with a new generation of  miniature satellite pop up tags (15 individuals to be equipped in year 2) will enable us to track, for the first time, diel horizontal and vertical migrations. Field sampling and tagging efforts will be conducted during the initial spring downstream migration and throughout the feeding season in the estuary (July to September) during the first two years of the  project: 2010 and 2011. 2010 will constitute a test year, with a reduced number of tagged eels and receivers deployed. 2011 will mark the first year where all equipment is to be fully deployed.

NLWF,OTN-Global,Newfoundland Wolffish,"Three wolffish species are found in Canadian Atlantic waters: Anarhichas denticulatus (Northern Wolffish), A. minor (Spotted Wolffish), and A. lupus (Atlantic Wolffish). The first two species are designated “threatened” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA), whereas Atlantic wolffish is designated as “of special concern”. Similar to many other marine species, which mainly inhabit the offshore, very little is known in regard to the movements and behaviour of wolffish. Often the main source of information on fish distribution is limited to bottom trawl surveys, while remote sensing is often used to obtain habitat data. In both cases, these data are captured on the scale of square kilometers while individual fish interact with the habitat on the scale of tens of meters, which creates a spatial disconnect. This project employs acoustic tags to increase our knowledge of the movement of individual wolffish, which is key to understanding how wolffish populations are distributed in space and time. As well, this knowledge will help in our understanding of important wolffish life history stages. This is a SPERA project dataset.","Simpson, M., Mello, L., Holloway, C., Maddigan, T. 2010.

NSP,OTN-Global,Nova Scotia Power,"The first of three installations of in-stream tidal power infrastructure in the Minas Passage of the inner Bay of Fundy was deployed in November 2009. Little is known about the impact of turbine operation on the survival and behaviour of fishes moving through the Passage. To address the potential for fish-turbine interactions near the deployed OpenHydro turbine, we are using animal tracking technology developed by Vemco of Halifax, Nova Scotia, to track fish movement, behaviour and environmental preferences over a scale of kilometres. This project will provide real in-situ measurements of the direction, depth and velocity of tagged fishes moving through the Passage. Three species of concern will be tagged during 2010: Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass and American eels. Fishes tagged with acoustic transmitting tags will broadcast unique signals that will be archived by an array of acoustic hydrophone receivers in the Minas Passage. A dense array of receivers located at the OpenHydro turbine site will provide fine scale information on movements and behaviour of fish in relation to an operating tidal turbine. In addition a line of receivers spanning the Passage, placed in co-operation with OTN and Acadia University, will provide information on the spatial and temporal distribution and movement of fish in the Passage. To enhance the assessment of the risk to fishes of direct contact with the turbine, in situ data will be used to refine mathematical hydrodynamic models that predict how objects like fish move in the Passage and potentially interact with turbine infrastructure. This information will be valuable in identifying mitigation measures that may be taken to lessen any negative effects of in-stream turbine infrastructure on fish behaviour and survival.","Broome, J., Stokesbury, M., Redden, A., Bradford, R. 2009. 3-D Acoustic  Tracking of Fish, Sediment-Laden Ice and Large Wood Debris in the  Minas Passage of the Bay of Fundy.",Anna Redden,Acadia U,anna.redden@acadiau.ca,http://www.bofep.org/minas.htm,ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS; DETECTIONS; ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS; ; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH,GCMD,,,"By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

PBN,OTN-Global,NOAA Penobscot Salmon Tracking,"NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA) has been evaluating emigrating Atlantic salmon (ATS) smolt dynamics and survival via ultrasonic telemetry since 1997 (Kocik et al. 2009). Initial telemetry  studies were of native populations in the Narraguagus River and have since expanded to other rivers and varying age classes of both hatchery and naturally-reared smolts. NOAA's present focus is on the  Penobscot River. Although the Penobscot River boasts the largest number of adult ATS returns in the northeast United States (~2,000 annually), smolt to adult return rates remain below 1% (USASAC 2010).  Smolt telemetry research on the Penobscot River has been taking place since 2005; we have used a variety of smolt origins in our assessments which are representative of naturally-reared and hatchery products  used in restoration activities in the system. We are focused on better understanding smolt migration dynamics, quantifying migration success and identifying areas of high mortality through estuarine and bay  areas within the study array and beyond into coastal waters in collaborations with OTN and other partners. We use this information in support of management activities to reduce threats, evaluate project  impacts and work windows, and to improve ATS survival in the near shore marine environment. NOAA's Penobscot Marine Array uses acoustic telemetry in Penobscot estuary and bay to passively monitor smolt movements through a static array of over 130 receivers, which are maintained in cooperation the University of Maine.  Objectives are to identify important migration corridors, evaluate migration behavior, and measure estuary and coastal survival to the Gulf of Maine.","Kocik, J.F., Hawkes, J.P., Goulette, G.S. 2009.

PRT,OTN-Global,OTN Perth Line,"The concept for the line that was originally called West Cape Howe and was to capture physical oceanographic data to improve the Ocean model BRAN, is now called the Perth Line. In this system, ocean currents sweep southward from waters around Indonesia. Multiple species of commercially valuable animals interact with this ocean current. BRAN is currently the most sophisticated ocean model in the world, and it is built solely on remote sensing (satellite) data. Measurements from below the ocean's surface will greatly increase the accuracy of the model. OTN receivers will provide the biological part of an ocean observation system that will collect sub surface data from measurement of physical and biological variables using moored sensors and tagged animals. This line was moved slightly north from its original proposed position as the Perth area is more accessible, and recent tracking has proven that the Perth area is a hotspot for multi-species animal migrations. Whale sharks are one species of interest in the system. They draw in many tourists and therefore are very economically valuable to the economy of this area. Other animals that will also be tagged in the vicinity will include Great White sharks and valuable tuna species. AATAMS has many on-going research studies in nearby Nigaloo reef.

RRT,OTN-Global,PEI Rainbow Trout Tracking,"On Prince Edward Island, recent decades have been marked by declines  in native salmonid populations. Most notably, Atlantic salmon (Salmo  salar) have been eliminated from 69% of their original range.  Alternately, non-native rainbow trout (Oncoryhnchus mykiss) have  established anadramous populations in at least 21 watersheds across  the Island; their relative success indicates that they are  competitively advantaged in this ecosystem. Indeed, there is concern  that juvenile rainbow trout may out-compete Atlantic salmon for riffle  habitat, contributing to their decline on the Island. One plausible  explanation for the success of rainbow trout is their resilience to  environmental perturbation (e.g. sedimentation or pesticide runoff).  To better understand the lifecycle of rainbow trout, adult trout were  tagged and tracked using sonic telemetry in collaboration with the  Ocean Tracking Network. We investigated the hypothesis that PEI may be  a source of vagrant rainbow trout migrating throughout the Gulf of St  Lawrence. Trout were tagged in rivers draining into the Monatgue  estuary. Trout in this study did not migrate long distances, in fact  none of the tagged fish left the receiver arrays in the estuary.  During the study period nutrient loading and water chemistry were  monitored throughout the watershed. Like many estuaries across PEI,  mid-summer macroalgal blooms resulted in depleted oxygen levels.  Tagged fish exhibited an extreme tolerance for both the high  temperature and the hypoxic and anoxic conditions, showing no  avoidance of such conditions. Thus, this investigation adds support to  the body of information suggesting the rainbow trout have been  successful because of their tolerance of degraded ecosystem integrity.","Roloson, S.D., Van Den Heuvel, M.R., Dupuis, T., Carr, J. 2011.

SCIUI,OTN-Global,Stress On the Reef,"Coral reefs worldwide are disappearing at an alarming rate, as are ecosystem services they provide. A crucial factor boosting coral reefs resilience, is herbivory by fishes. However, herbivorous reef fishes, along with the habitat they occupy, are subjected to considerable environmental stressors (e.g., pollution, climate change, habitat degradation, tourism, fisheries). Apart from direct mortality, such stressors have shown to induce non-lethal stress which may result in decreasing fitness, yet it is unknown if individual stress scales-up to the population level and how it might lead to a cascading effect. I will experimentally subject fish to stress by exposing them to fear of predation and advanced hormonal manipulations. Cutting-edge technology will be used to track fishes� three-dimensional movements and activities in the wild. Evaluating the extent of fishes� spatio-temporal response will provide information needed to understand how herbivorous fishes impact on the coral reef changes due to natural and anthropogenic stressors.","Crossin, G., Belmaker, J., Kiflawi, M., Pickholtz, R. 2016.

SGB,OTN-Global,OTN Strait of Gibraltar Line,"The Mediterranean is one of the economically most important seas in the world and its only natural entrance is the Strait of Gibraltar. All sea life and commerce passes through this 14-km wide passage and the high evaporation rate causes dense highly saline water to form and sink inside. This leads to surface inflow from the North Atlantic and bottom outflow of western Mediterranean deep water that flows into the Atlantic and affects the deep ocean thermohaline circulation called the global “air conditioner.” This system is vulnerable to climate change and may have positive feedback effects. The currents can be very variable under the influence of winds and tides and regulate the movements of both commercial and conservation species. The Gibraltar Line is ideally suited to monitor and understand all of these phenomena. It is deep enough to avoid interference from commercial traffic and operates as a continuous ocean observation system to detect rare events, both oceanographic and biological. It complements satellite observations of surface waters. There are plans to monitor species including iconic whales, turtles, and tuna, as well as commercial bream, cuttlefish, octopus, squid, and eels. The Line itself has been carefully surveyed and will require 26 km of equipment to avoid excessive depths and currents as well as trawlable bottom. The highest profile species is the bluefin tuna, which can sell for over $100,000 each and were recently proposed and denied CITES status after years of overfishing.

The beaches and waters surrounding the island are pupping and overwintering areas for a large population of grey seals. These seals are the subject of a long-term monitoring program being carried out by DFO and Dalhousie University, and of telemetry investigations by OTN researchers. The OTN researchers’ work with the animals of Sable Island is primarily focused on the grey seals, which are being equipped with both satellite tags and acoustic mobile transceivers (Vemco VMTs) to track their movements and document interactions with other acoustically tagged species such as the Atlantic cod. These double tagged animals are termed Bio-probes, and by linking the satellite tag’s communications with the acoustic receiver via Bluetooth technology, the seal’s positions and any detections of other acoustically tagged animals are reported in near-real time. In addition, a moored array of acoustic receivers rings the island, to determine if acoustically tagged predators such as white sharks come to Sable Island hunting grey seals. This array also serves to log other acoustically tagged animals which might be attracted to this island.

SIUI,OTN-Global,"Marine invasive species: Eilat, Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea","Marine invasive species have become a widespread phenomenon, with devastating ecological and economic consequences. Current research focuses mainly on monitoring the ecological impacts of invasive species, rather than aiming to understand the mechanisms facilitate or drive them. Landscape characteristics such as substrate configuration, patchiness, and resource availability, are known determinants of the behavior and distribution of marine species. Such components change substantially over space and time, and little is known on how the impact of invasive species may vary accordingly. This research focuses on an invasive rabbitfish species Siganus rivulatus, previously native to the Indo-Pacific. Along the Mediterranean coast, S. rivulatus is shown to have devastating impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems� resilience, and community structures. My research aims to understand how the species� behavior and impact are facilitated or restricted by the surrounding landscape, directly comparing the native and invasive ranges of this species. By employing state-of-the-art technology, previously unused in Israel, fish movements will be recorded in real-time through acoustic tags. Data of such high resolution will enable to quantify fundamental parameters such as home range kernels, habitat utilization, and movement trajectories. By conducting a similar study at the native region (Red Sea; Eilat) and the invaded region (Mediterranean; Sdot-Yam) I will gain insight into the behavioral landscape ecology of S. rivulatus, and the behavioral shifts that may have occurred as a result of invading a novel ecosystem.

SMED,OTN-Global,"Sdot Yam, Haifa District:  The Spatial Ecology of an Invasive Herbivorous Fish (Siganus rivulatus) in its Native and Invaded Range","Marine invasive species have become a widespread phenomenon, with devastating ecological and economic consequences. Current research focuses mainly on monitoring the ecological impacts of invasive species, rather than aiming to understand the mechanisms facilitate or drive them. Landscape characteristics such as substrate configuration, patchiness, and resource availability, are known determinants of the behavior and distribution of marine species. Such components change substantially over space and time, and little is known on how the impact of invasive species may vary accordingly. This research focuses on an invasive rabbitfish species Siganus rivulatus, previously native to the Indo-Pacific. Along the Mediterranean coast, S. rivulatus is shown to have devastating impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems’ resilience, and community structures. My research aims to understand how the species’ behavior and impact are facilitated or restricted by the surrounding landscape, directly comparing the native and invasive ranges of this species. By employing state-of-the-art technology, previously unused in Israel, fish movements will be recorded in real-time through acoustic tags. Data of such high resolution will enable to quantify fundamental parameters such as home range kernels, habitat utilization, and movement trajectories. By conducting a similar study at the native region (Red Sea; Eilat) and the invaded region (Mediterranean; Sdot-Yam) I aim to gain insight into the behavioral landscape ecology of S. rivulatus, and the behavioral shifts that may have occurred as a result of invading a novel ecosystem. Finally, movement patterns of S. rivulatus can be used to understand the degree of landscape connectivity in the Mediterranean, thereby predicting further expansion.","Belmaker, J., Kiflawi, M., Pickholtz, R. 2014.

TNC,OTN-Global,Terra Nova National Park Cod,"Landscape approaches are rare in marine systems and movement studies do not often identify critical stages or habitat preferences and connectivity within specific life stages. Juvenile cod typically disperse from quality eelgrass rearing habitat at higher rates as large individuals (>15 cm long) than as small ones. Gregory and students are conducting two primary experiments to determine: (1) between-habitat patch flux rates and (2) dispersal potential of juvenile cod in coastal landscapes. Investigators are using acoustic technology to determine rates of movement and dispersal of small juvenile cod with respect to isolated habitat patches. This project incorporates the use of surgically implanted acoustic transmitter tags in the field. The location of 84 tagged juvenile cod are being monitored for up to a year each as they move within and away from specific high quality habitat patch locations within a coastal marine landscape. A total of ca. 200 fixed station hydrophones are deployed in arrays at three spatial scales - near-field (10s of m), far-field (km), and distant-field (10s of km) - centred on two capture-tag-release locations in Newman Sound, Newfoundland. In October 2010, 42 sonically tagged individuals were released into isolated and continuous patches of eelgrass to test the hypothesis that movement of small juvenile fish is inversely related to inter-patch distances (i.e., landscape quality). In November 2011, an additional 42 tagged juveniles were released in a reciprocal translocation experiment between these two types of habitat, with another 42 juveniles released in November 2011, to investigate “point of no return” to home areas within the landscape.

V2LCELA,OTN-Global,OTN VR2W Loan - Coastal Everglades Lakes Acoustic Array,"One important mechanism driving coastal ecosystem change is the loss of highly mobile upper trophic level species. Coastal impacts are particularly high on top and mesopredators, which have suffered disproportionate extinctions and local depletions worldwide. Appropriate ecosystem-based management and large-scale restoration necessitates a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic drivers on the spatial ecology (movement, habitat use and distributional patterns) of coastal top and mesopredators. The coastal Everglades are an iconic freshwater and estuarine ecosystem, strongly impacted by changes in freshwater delivery (due to upstream drainage and impoundment), and highly vulnerable to sea level rise (2/3 of Everglades National Park is below 3 ft above sea level). Despite this high socioecological value of the coastal Everglades, the effects of over 100 years of altered hydrology on the ecology of these predatory species remains poorly understood. More importantly, our understanding of how these species will respond to the balance of restoration actions (designed to increase freshwater deliveries) and sea level rise is very limited. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to establish CELA2 (Coastal Everglades Lakes Acoustic Array). The purpose of the array is to examine the spatial ecology of coastal predators in relation to key hydroclimatic and habitat drivers. In particular, our research asks the following questions: (1) How does the movement, habitat use and distribution of top and mesopredators in coastal Everglades habitats vary across space (lakes, creeks and coastal embayments of Florida Bay) and time (wet vs. dry season and years of varying freshwater inflows)? (2) What is the relative role of hydrological (e.g., freshwater flows, salinity), climatic (e.g., temperature, wind, storms), and habitat characteristics (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, vegetation cover) in driving predator patterns of movement, habitat use and distribution? (3) In particular, how is predator movement, habitat use and distribution influenced by state changes related to eutrophication?  (4) And, to what extent are spatial patterns and responses to environmental drivers species-specific? CELA2 encompasses the Alligator Creek and McCormick Creek  subestuaries in northcentral Florida Bay, Everglades National Park. Both systems contain a series of lakes connected by creeks and with outlets to Florida Bay. Both systems are characterized by a north to south gradient in salinity, with overall higher salinity conditions relative to the pre-drainage Everglades. With lower freshwater inflows, the region has undergone nutrient enrichment resulting from a greater influence of nutrient-rich marine, and in particular the Allligator Creek system has undergone a state change, from an SAV dominated systems to an enriched phytoplankton state. We hypothesize that this shift in benthic to planktonic primary production will influence habitat quality for predators via its effects on abiotic regimes (e.g., oxygen, visibility), and on secondary production (e.g., prey quantity, quality and availability). This system provides a unique opportunity to examine and compare the effects of enrichment on a coastal system and assess its effects up the trophic food web to top consumers.",Rehage JS et al. 2016.

V2LCHASES,OTN-Global,Consequences of land-use change and human activity on anadromous salmonids and the ecosystem services that they provide,"Brown trout may live the entire life in freshwater (resident trout) or occasionally migrate to sea (sea trout). In theory, individuals should migrate to sea if such behavior increases reproductive success. It has been shown, that migratory differences not only rely to resident or migratory individuals. Within a seaward migrating group of trout, large differences in distance migrated away from the river can often be found. Some stay close, while other migrates far away. In this project, we will aim to map physiologically differences between juvenile trout that become residents or migrate to sea and between short and long distance migratory sea trout. Seaward migration is a behavior that can be expected when the gain for the individual fish is higher than the cost. Consequently, one can expect that this behavior will be changed or disappear if sea conditions are so negative for sea trout that it loses reproductive potential by migrating to sea.","Davidsen, J.G. et al 2016.

V2LCV,OTN-Global,OTN VR2W Loan - Cabo Verde: Nurse and Lemon shark.,"More than 60 elasmobranch species inhabit the waters of Cabo Verde Island. The assemblage include a wide spectrum of species from large and small coastal species to pelagic species and from highly migratory to resident species, as well as species endemic to Cabo Verde, such as the Cabo Verde skate, Raja herwigi, and semi-endemic species (endemic to West Africa), such as the Atlantic weasel shark, Paragaleus pectoralis. Neonates and adult individuals are present and this wide demographic spread indicates that essential and important, but largely uncharacterized, habitats of elasmobranch are present in this region and it is believed to be one of the last refugees for elasmobranchs in West Africa, and indeed the North Atlantic Ocean. However, detailed scientific information is scarce preventing any science-based management efforts. The high value of this area in conjunction with the ability to study and protect some species within Marine Protected Areas means the region can offer some degree of sanctuary from the world-wide decline in elasmobranch species. This decline is mainly triggered by the high demand for shark fins and flesh and primarily the result of unstainable fishing practices and lacking or inadequate management. There is growing public and scientific concern over the global decline of elasmobranch populations and the consequences of such declines include changes in the structure, function and stability of marine ecosystems. Currently, there is no stock assessment available for any elasmobranch species in Cabo Verde and although marine reserves have been established, their benefit for elasmobranch conservation remains unclear. Hence, more detailed scientific information is needed to allow for a comprehensive and successful elasmobranch conservation strategy in Cabo Verde. Moreover, the characterization and conservation of Cabo Verde elasmobranch populations will contribute to both, the preservation of species diversity and support a sustainable resource for ecotourism and fisheries. Therefore, the Cabo Verde Elasmobranch Research Project aims to improve our understanding of the biology, ecology, and conservation status of elasmobranchs in Cabo Verde waters in order to provide a scientific basis for comprehensive protection and management, aid the science of these species and to benefit local communities and Cabo Verde in terms of fisheries, education and maintenance of biodiversity. The Project is based on an interdisciplinary approach with the goal of bringing together international and Cabo Verdean researchers, government representatives and resource managers, industry, NGOs and local communities, translating scientific information into on-the-water conservation measures and ensuring the effectiveness of management efforts. Canadian, Cabo Verdean and international researchers will collaborate to support long-term sustainability of elasmobranch populations through species assessments, field surveys, collection of fisheries data, telemetry studies, stock assessments, the collection of biological or environmental data, and gathering local ecological knowledge observations. The local knowledge of Cabo Verdeans who use the sea, such as traditional fishermen, will be an invaluable assistance in achieving these goals.","Dureuil, M., Worm, B., Townsend, B., Whoriskey, F., Harvey-Clark, C., Monteiro, C., Martins, A., Silva, P., Evora, D., Melo, T., Rendall Rocha, P., Portugues, S., Stiebens, V. 2015",Fred Whoriskey,OTN,fwhoriskey@dal.ca,http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/V2LCV.htm,ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS; DETECTIONS; ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS; ; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH,GCMD,,,"By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

V2LDRUM,OTN-Global,Assessing the role of estuarine impoundments and marine mammal exclusion devices on red drum movement patterns,"The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) is one of the most diverse estuaries in North America and serves as critical habitat for a multitude of fish species.  One of the most economically valuable sportfish in the Indian River Lagoon is the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Previous local studies of red drum document strong site fidelity, with some mature individuals residing and spawning within the lagoon year-round (Reyier et al 2011).  This behavior is uncommon in other portions of their geographic range, suggesting future abundance and harvest of red drum is partially dependent on continued spawning success within the lagoon. The Integrate-Transfer-Launch (ITL) complex impoundments located within Kennedy Space Center security zone are proven spawning sites of red drum (Garreau et al 2014).  However, recent construction of manatee exclusion bollards around culverts leading into these impoundments on roads operated by Cape Canaveral Air Force Station may be impacting movement to and from these historic spawning sites. This project proposes to use acoustic telemetry to quantify patterns of red drum movement and habitat use within the Kennedy Space Center security zone, and to assess how manatee exclusion bollards in the ITL-impoundment area potentially impact movement of red drum.  These data will be used in conjunction with bollard size and spacing, pertinent morphometric data (e.g. length, head width, body width, weight), and habitat conditions to develop optimal management strategies that minimize potential adverse effects on manatees and maximize red drum access to spawning sites, thereby helping to ensure the sustainability of this iconic fishery.","Baker, SM., Reyier, EA., Cook, GS. 2017.

This is the first effort to build telemetry infrastructure at the Gulf-wide scale, and to concurrently assess movement patterns of the same species but in different regions, with varying accessibility to natural and artificial reefs.  We will take an integrative research approach to this project (van Kerkhoff, 2013).  This will include: engaging stakeholders, drawing on the expertise of a steering committee and wider group of telemetry scientists, connecting this group and their knowledge with that of the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) and fostering a learning orientation, i.e., developing array designs and hypotheses, with the intent of revising these as our knowledge of the systems being studied improves.  All receiver deployments will be designed to increase the spatial monitoring of on-going telemetry studies as well as to increase the ability to detect regional scale movements within the Gulf of Mexico.  Initial studies will primarily focus on deploying receivers in: the Florida Keys, the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, with the intent of revising locations as needed and the potential to also increase coverage off of western Florida.  The target species will be Red Snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and Greater Amberjack (Seriola dumerili).

V2LIMFSTP,OTN-Global,OTN VR2AR Loan - Marine Scotland Science Inner Moray Firth Smolt Tracking Project,"Marine Scotland Science (MSS) have installed an array of 40 Vemco VR2AR acoustic receivers running between Burghead and Tarbat Ness. It provides coverage across part of the inner Moray Firth to detect tagged Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts and sea trout (Salmo trutta) smolts as they migrate from the Cromarty Firth. The VR2ARs are on loan from the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN). The  Array has been installed to give more information on the migration routes of the smolts tagged in the Conon River system. 150 salmon and 20 sea trout smolts were tagged in late April with 7 mm coded acoustic tags by the Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment (SCENE). SCENE have been  Commissioned by Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited BOWL to carry out this work to discharge Section 36 consent and Marine Licence conditions. The salmon smolts were collected from the River Bran (a tributary of the Conon) at Achanalt. Fish were tagged and then immediately released downstream of the Torr Achilty power station on the lower River Conon to continue their migration.  Two types of tags were used, Thelma Biotel (ADT-LP-7,3) in salmon smolts and Vemco (V7) in sea trout smolts. MSS have designed and commissioned pop-up rope canisters to house the VR2ARs to allow the recovery of the weights and avoid acoustic shadows caused by flotation buoys above the hydrophone. These rope canisters were designed to Accommodate up to 150 m of 4 mm Dyneema rope. This allows the safe recovery of the 70 kg clump anchor weights in up to 100 m of water. The installation of the VR2ARs was carried out on the Coral Wind on the 19th April 2016 and all 40 moorings were deployed in one day. MSS have scheduled the receiver recovery for the start of August. We plan to provide initial assessments of patterns in the migration vectors of the fish leaving the Cromarty Firth by late autumn.","Gardiner, R., Stainer, P., Edwards, E., Watret, R., Thorburn, J., Newton, M., Main, R. 2016.

V2LJPN,OTN-Global,Tracking Hammerhead Sharks in Japan,"Hammerhead sharks are arguably among the most recognizable and fascinating shark species among scientists and the public. However, it is the hammerhead sharks, particularly the scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini, which are showing among the most drastic declines of all large-bodied sharks worldwide, between 80-90% in many parts of the world (Myers et al 2007, Ferretti et al 2008, Ferretti et al 2010). While there currently are very few data on population trends in other parts of their range (i.e., Asian Pacific), these areas have limited recording of catch data and poor management of fisheries, and there are concerns that declines for this species may be equal or greater in these areas. The scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, is the only extant, large-bodied shark species that displays highly organized and complex social behavior (e.g., Klimley and Nelson 1981). Large, sexually-segregated groups are known to school in a few, predictable locations, including Cocos Island, the Galapagos, and the Gulf of California. These stocks are highly vulnerable in these phases, and as such the above locations have all benefited from some form of local protective measures. For example, hammerhead sharks in the Galapagos and Cocos Island are both protected under marine reserves, the former of which being a world heritage site. Since this species is highly vulnerable when they aggregate, these aggregations are well-suited for protective measures. However, marine spatial planning and reserve design and implementation are impossible without a deep understanding of the dynamics of the aggregation. We initiated an expedition and study to advance our understanding of a new aggregation of scalloped hammerhead sharks off coastal Japan. Our overarching objective is to gather spatial, temporal, and behavioral data on an isolated and unprotected aggregation of scalloped hammerhead sharks found off Japan. There are several project goals: To gather baseline data on the daily, monthly, and yearly presence of sharks at the island and determine size and sex-based differences. To characterize the home range and space utilization of sharks at the island and to correlate visitation frequency patterns with the abundance of prey species and localised oceanography. To explore the social networks of large social apex predatory sharks by quantifying and comparing empirical linkages in habitat use. To determine the site fidelity and social networks of sharks to better understand the seasonal risks they face when they are absent and present from the island. To establish a long-term research and monitoring project with the local dive center and communities that will generate consistent data reporting, local stewardship in research and conservation.","Jacoby, D., Papastamatiou, Y., Watanabe, Y., Gallagher, A. 2015.

In my study, I will tag lionfish of the species Pterios volitans and Pterois miles, track their movement and compare it to the sea floor coverage-type such as corals, sea-grass and other abiotic parameters. Lionfish are now one of the most severe threats to the western North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea native species (Bacheler N.M. 2015). Since Lionfish are considered an invasive species and impact many reef fish communities, as well as commercially valuable species, it is crucial to minimize these escalating impacts. Studying and understanding species behavior and distribution will help in developing careful management approach, aiding in controlling lionfish populations. During my research i will tag lionfish at different life stages and compare their movement behavior across the reef environment to those of the lionfish from the invaded areas, as well as to the natural relief of their habitat.","Ginat, N., Josef, N., Aruety, T., Shashar, N. 2016.

Of the 33 char acoustically tracked in 2009, 15 (45%) ventured beyond 10 km of either of the Armshow or Sylvia Grinnell river mouths and 9 (27%) were detected in both rivers’ estuaries. Marine mortality was estimated at 24.2% with 62.5% of the mortalities occurring within the Sylvia Grinnell River estuary. Assuming an emigration date of June 18th in both 2008 and 2009, marine migration duration was 46 to 78 days. Mean durations were 59±6 in 2008, 65±7 in 2009 and 63±7 days combined. Tracking revealed migrant movements into the intertidal zone with the flood and ebb of the tide. Most detections were in surface waters (0 to 3 m). Inter/sub-tidal movements and consecutive repetitive dives (maximum 52.8 m) resulted in extreme body temperature shifts (-0.2 to18.1oC). Approximately half of intertidal and subtidal detections were between 9 to13oC, and 1 to 3oC, respectively. Stomach contents and deep diving suggested feeding in both inter/sub-tidal zones.

MCS,OTN-Global,Maine DMR: Coastal rivers Adult Salmon Stocking,"Bureau of Sea Run Fisheries and Habitat (BSRFH) staff annually release excess captivereared gravid adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) broodstock for augmentation and comparison of current juvenile  production from fry stocking. Staff biologists have observed broodstock spawning, documented creation of viable redds by fry trapping, documented juvenile production to the parr lifestage by electrofishing,  and trapped emigrating smolts. However, during redd count surveys, BSRFH staff observations suggest approximately 50% of the adult salmon transplanted in a spawning stream are not seen during spawning. It is  uncertain if the unobserved adults are being removed from the stream by predators or poachers, or if they are experiencing mortality due to decreased fitness or stress prior to spawning. It is also possible that broodstock are leaving the transplanted stream and spawning in other areas of drainages. Movement of adults outside study reaches potentially  confounds wild salmon return estimates, may lead to negative biological interaction with wild conspecifics, and limits agency ability to fully assess juvenile production potential of captive-reared  broodstock. Further assessment of the movements and behavior of transplanted broodstock before, during, and after spawning is needed. The objectives of this study are: (1) to document captive-reared gravid  adult Atlantic salmon broodstock spawning behavior, locations, and movements within a release stream or in other reaches of a drainage; (2) quantitatively assess juvenile production from in-river spawning of captive-reared broodstock for comparison with production from fry point stocking; (3) document post-spawn movement of kelts; and (4) document post-spawn habitat used by  overwintering kelts.","Bruchs, C.W.B., Atkinson, E.J., Zydlewski, J. 2010.

V2LWATCH,OTN-Global,OTN VR2W Loan - The Wash Animal Tracking Hub,"Recruitment of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) has reduced by greater than 90% since the early 1980's in some parts of Europe, and the stock is now considered outside safe biological limits. Exact causes of the decline remain unclear\; however, riverine barriers to seaward migrating adult eels (silver eels hereafter) are considered a key factor. Specifically, intake screens, pumps and turbines at pumping stations for domestic supply, agriculture and industry, flood control and hydropower generation, can result in the delay or cessation of migration, physical damage and direct mortality of silver eels due to their elongated morphology and poor burst swimming capabilities. For those that do survive, little is known about the impact on the marine phase of silver eel migration. In fact, little is known about the marine phase of silver eel migration generally. To reverse the decline in European eel populations, the European Union has adopted the Eel Recovery Plan (Council Regulation No 1100/2007/EC). This requires all Member States to produce Eel Management Plans (EMPs) detailing actions to meet the target to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock. Mitigation for the effects of riverine barriers and improvements to downstream passage has been highlighted as a key means of achieving escapement targets across Europe (e.g. U.K., Denmark, Greece EMPs). Furthermore, under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) member states are obliged to ensure fish passage at all artificial structures. To meet legislative escapement targets it is important to identify key locations of silver eel loss during freshwater migration. This has led to an ongoing investigation into silver eel migration and entrainment in three rivers that enter The Wash, England. The downstream limit of the study is current the tidal limit. With the support of the OTN a line of receivers will be deployed across the mouth of The Wash to investigate the initial marine phase of the eel migration. To this end, the study will be divided into the following specific objectives: i) Determine the catchment-wide downstream migration of silver eels in relation to environmental conditions (river flow, water temperatures, lunar phase and time of day) and pumping station operation using acoustic tags and receivers. ii) Determine the initial marine phase migration of silver eel captured in freshwater, tagged and released downstream of the pumping station. iii) Assess the impact of passage through pumping stations on the initial marine phase of the eel migration. The information gained will provide valuable guidance for optimising escapement of adult eels, in line with EU requirements, at the respective study sites. In addition, the Environment Agency and national conservation organisations will be able to use these outputs to inform, underpin and revise policy and conservation practices to deliver appropriate protection for the species nationally.","Bolland, D. 2015.

The Department then deployed 19 VR2W receivers on navigation buoys throughout the Passamaquoddy Bay, Letete Passage and Lubec Channel. These receivers were placed in locations hypothesized to be key migration routes for anadromous fish species. Results indicated that alewife migrate out of the St. Croix River through the Western Passage and up into more northern waters, near the mouth of the Letete Passage.

V2LRIC,OTN-Global,OTN VR2W Loan - 2016 Malpeque Bay (after the fishing season),"Interactions between bivalve aquaculture and the environment are complex. In suspended mussel culture, great quantities of mussels may fall from culture structures and this and the physical farming structure added to an area may attract a variety of predatory and scavenging species. Little work has addressed how such changes may have bottom-up effects that impact fisheries species. Impacts may include not only ecological effects, but also effects on the fisheries due to altered productivity, distribution, or catchability of target species. Indeed, it is widely perceived by fishers that lobsters that congregate in aquaculture sites may become sedentary and thus are unavailable to the fishery for this species and lobster fishers often set up their cages immediately outside of farm sites in areas where lobster fishing grounds overlap with mussel culture. Concerns about the influence of mussel culture sites on lobster distribution and condition pose challenges for managers who evaluate new requests for mussel farms as scientific information on the subject are largely absent. This study examines the spatial distribution and movement of lobster within and around mussel culture sites to evaluate their availability to the fishery. We examined the movement of 20 lobsters (Homarus americanus) in and around operational mussel farms in western Malpeque Bay, Prince Edward Island (Richmond Bay) in the summer-fall of 2015. The area has a soft sediment bottom and is about 5-8 m deep at low tide. The animals were tagged with Vemco V9 69 kHz acoustic transmitters in July and their movements followed by triangulation of signals captured by a total of 21 Vemco VR2W receivers deployed in and around the site (0.9 km2 total coverage\; July through September).","McKindsey, C., Drouin, A., Simard, E., Archambault, P. 2016.

V2LSBERS,OTN-Global,Scatarie Bank Experiential Research Site,"Scatarie Bank is positioned within Zone 1 of the St Anns Bank Marine Protected Area, approximately 25 nautical miles from the easternmost tip of the Scatarie Island Wilderness Area, and closer to the coast than any other marine protected area on the Scotian Shelf. The Bank comprises the shallowest seabed within the MPA, ranging from 22 - 55m in depth. An augmented citizen science monitoring program will be established that engages the local SCUBA diving community, as well as coastal communities bordering the MPA, in a combined effort to annually evaluate the status of the marine community at this uniquely accessible offshore ocean feature. Based on photo/video images, research trawl surveys, fishery and bycatch data, the benthic species composition within St. Anns Bank MPA appears to be strongly associated with depth and substrate type. Consequently, the benthic community assemblage of bank habitats is distinguishable from those of basin and slope communities, albeit with considerable overlap in species distributions. Hard bottom communities within the MPA are for the most part too deep to support macroalgal growth, and instead receive most of their energy inputs in the form of organic detritus and dissolved organic material. Shallower regions, however, are characterized by a high algal cover (encrusting coralline algae, red algal turf, and even kelp), sessile invertebrates (including encrusting sponges, anemones, bryozoans and tunicates), as well as mobile invertebrates (shrimp, crab, urchins, sea cucumber, basket stars). Preliminary assessments of the shallow hard bottom habitats of Scatarie Bank, much of which resides within the photic zone, suggest that Scatarie Bank is distinct from deeper water bank environments in the MPA, and may be worthy of conservation priority. At only 22m depth, the peak of Scatarie Bank may be of significance to older life-history stages of cod and to large adult wolffish, which are known to seek shelter among rocks and vertical relief in rugose, high energy marine habitats. Atlantic wolffish are currently listed by SARA and COSEWIC as a species of ""special concern"". The site may also serve as a settlement and recruitment outpost for larvae of shallow water species carried by currents of either arctic or tropical origin, and hence may be a hotspot for marine biodiversity that will reveal forerunners of expanding and contracting species' ranges during climate change. Within the context of the recently gazetted St. Anns Bank MPA, and the newly emerging Scotian Shelf Network of MPAs, Scatarie Bank appears to represent a distinct region of interest for ecological assessment and monitoring of connectivity. It is also situated within three hours boat ride from Main a Dieu harbour, the closest coastal fishing community, and a small area (approx. 3km2) is accessible to SCUBA-based recreational and research activities. As such, it represents an ideal location to establish a permanent research site within the MPA. Appropriate exposure and promotion of its beauty and opportunity could galvanize public interest and support for the newly established St. Anns Bank MPA, as well as to act as a focal point for academic and citizen-based scientific research.","Penney, M., Hatcher, B., Rawlings, T. 2017.

The species is migratory, based on the seasonal disappearance and reappearance of crabs in different geographical areas, and limited tagging studies that have been conducted to date. However, the tagging studies necessary to document the scale and scope of such migrations have not yet been conducted. Information about the migratory movements of the species will be  very important to managers as they determine  quotas for fisheries in the different crab fishing zones (geographical management areas). At present, snow crab movements are too poorly understood to assist in developing management regimes for the species.

V2LUMI,OTN-Global,OTN VR2W Loan - Bahamas Tiger Beach Shark Ecology Project,"The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is the largest predatory fish in tropical seas. While the behavioral ecology of tiger sharks has been well-studied in the Pacific and Indian Ocean, little is known about the movement patters of tiger sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. By satellite tracking tiger sharks tagged of Florida and the Bahamas, Hammerschlag et al. (2012) found that female tiger shark displayed a pelagic phase lasting several months, with movements following the Gulf Stream, warm currents that support productivity at all trophic levels. Sharks also exhibited an inshore, high residency phase at a popular dive tourism site in the Bahamas, nicknamed Tiger Beach (TB), located on the Northwest edge of little Bahama Bank. Tiger sharks at TB are provisioned by divers year-round by boats to lure tiger sharks within close proximity of dive tourists. While the long-term, large-scale movements of tiger sharks are not impacted by dive tourism at TB, it remains unknown if and how high residency, daily movements, of female sharks at TB are impacted by the provisioning tourism. This would be of particular conservation significance if female sharks were aggregating at TB for reproductive purposes, such as mating or gestating, as hypothesized Hammerschlag et al. (2012). To fill this gap in knowledge, the overall goal of this project is to evaluate the relationship among reproductive state, diet, body condition and residency patterns of female tiger sharks at TB to determine the following:  What are the overall site fidelity and residency patterns of sharks within TB? * Are there any diurnal differences in residency and movement in and out of TB? * Are there any seasonal differences in residency within TB? * Do sharks exhibit higher residency patterns at dive sites or disproportionately use dive sites compared to adjacent areas? * Do shark residency patterns at dive sites differ in the presence or absence of diving or baiting activities? * Do individuals differ in their spatial and temporal use of TB? * What is the pattern and frequency of tiger shark movements between TB and the US eastern seaboard?

V2LURB,OTN-Global,OTN VR2W Loan - Miami & Biscayne Bay Urban Shark Project,"Coastal marine habitats are some of the most ecologically and socio-economically important on the planet. Coastal development and urban sprawl are major threats to these ecosystems, generally displaying lower species diversity, stability, and productivity. However, many of these habitats are today used by a variety of flora and fauna that were previously associated with pristine, undisturbed habitat. Living among urban ecosystems may exact various alterations in species life-history such as increased access to food, shelter from weather, and decreased susceptibility to predators. To date, research aimed to better understand and mitigate the effects of biodiversity loss have focused on preserving large and pristine natural habitats, often overlooking altered urban ecosystems where fewer natural habitat remains. To address this knowledge gap, the goal of this project is to understand how coastal urbanization effects the behavior and ecology of sharks off Miami, Florida.

HFX,OTN-Global,OTN Halifax Line,"The Atlantic Ocean off of Halifax, Nova Scotia is home to a great variety of marine species, both resident and migratory. Since 2008, the Ocean Tracking Network, with the support of DFO, has maintained an acoustic receiver curtain to track movements of a varety of acoustically tagged species moving laterally along the East Coast continental shelf, or resident year round or seasonally in the Halifax Region. The OTN Halifax line spans the entire width of the continental shelf off of Halifax, and consists of hydrophone moorings at 800 m spacing over a total length of almost 205 km. This makes it the largest single fixed oceanographc monitoring system in the world.  The line meanders to avoid areas of intense trawling activity such as the Emerald Basin. In addition to acoustic receivers, several of these moorings contain instrumented packages called benthic pods that provide time series of bottom pressure (sea level height), temperature and salinity. This massive undertaking took four years to fully deploy. Data stored on receivers or the benthic pods retreived via autonomous vehicles (gliders) as well as manned vessel. Marine species tagged in over 20 OTN projects have been detected to date.","Whoriskey, F., Hebert, D., Barthelotte, J., O'Dor, R., Stokesbury, M., Branton, R. 2009.

QIK,OTN-Global,Habitat connectivity of Greenland halibut and Greenland sharks throughout Baffin Bay,"The Northern coast of Baffin Island is characterized by fjords and deep-water troughs created by glacial retreat that are now habitats for diverse deep-water species in the coastal area. There is interest in many Inuit communities along this coast to develop fisheries that target deep-water species such as the Greenland halibut which can bring much needed economic development to the area, however there already exists a relativly extensive offshore commercial fishery that targets this same species. Acoustic tracking work in Scott Inlet has determined that Greenland halibut often move between the coastal and offshore areas of Baffin Bay, yet the extent of thier movement in the offshore, and the connectivity between coastal fjords/troughs remains unknown. The addition of acoustic monitoring in the coastal trough and offshore area of Qikiqtarjuaq has been added to the Arctic monitoring program to compliment the work continuing in Scott Inlet to determine the level of connectivity between these coastal habitats as well as the offshore. In the interest of sustainable fisheries development, this project looks at stock connectivity of Greenland halibut as well as ecosystem interactions with other by-catch species, predominantly the Greenland shark and Arctic skate.","Hussey, NE. 2015.

V2LBBFSF,OTN-Global,Multi-elasmobranch species telemetry project,"Many elasmobranch populations are threatened worldwide by high rates of directed fishing and by-catch mortality in global fisheries, by marine pollution and habitat destruction. As such, dramatic declines have been reported from the world's oceans requiring the urgent need for collection of biological information on many shark species. Exacerbating this decline for sharks is their inherent vulnerability due to relatively slow growth and reproductive rates, and their propensity to migrate long distances crossing international boundaries thus making stock assessments and management difficult. Here, we employ passive acoustic telemetry to identify drivers of movement/migration, habitat and space use, species habitat preferences and core areas of abundance in a diverse guild of large elasmobranchs i.e. great hammerhead, tiger, bull, nurse, lemon, Caribbean reef, blacktip shark, and southern stingray. Analysis of acoustic monitoring data will help to direct conservation to local hotspots around Bimini and regional management among seemingly isolated populations.","Guttridge TL, Smukall M, van Zinnicq Bergmann MPM, Kessel ST & Gruber SH 2017.

This infrastructure includes state-of-the-art acoustic receivers and oceanographic monitoring equipment, and autonomous marine vehicles carrying oceanographic sensors and mobile acoustic receivers.  Long-life acoustic tags (n=40) implanted in the experimental animals will provide long-term spatial resolution of shark movements and distribution, trans-boundary migrations, site fidelity, and the species’ response to a changing ocean. This study will facilitate interspecific comparisons, documentation of intra- and interspecific interactions, and permit long-term monitoring of this understudied predator in the Northwest Atlantic.
